# Next Frontend Web

## Environment Variables

The application requires the following environment variables to be set:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` – Base URL used by the client for API requests.
- `API_PROXY_URL` – URL used by Next.js rewrites to proxy `/api/*` calls to the backend.

Define these variables in your environment or in a `.env` file before running or building the project.
